A short description of your app (its purpose and features): Our application is meant for students to open up and find information about their available libraries. They will be able to find a description of the library, an address, and with features such as a map and a favorite star. Students will also be able to rate the library.
A list of how your app addresses each of the requirements:
  -Delegation: "Rate Library" button send info back to the main page
  -NSLayoutConstraint: Used to place labels and buttons for example
  -Navigation: Push and present view controllers are on the app. "LibraryViewController" is for example a present view controller that showcases a library
  -Backend Integration: getLibraries, getMap, and star are examples of our attempts to integrate the backend. 
Anything else you want your grader to know: We tried our hardest on the backend but it was failing constantly.
Note: The link, screenshots, and description will be used for the Hack Challenge website where we will showcase everyoneâ€™s final projects
